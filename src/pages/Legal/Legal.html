              Body Sensing Smartwatches to Enable Adaptive Lighting Systems
            </p>
            
            <p>
              You are asked to participate in a research study conducted by Thomas W. Malone, Peter Gloor, and Robert Laubacher from the Center for Collective Intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you are participating in a workshop that Peter Gloor is leading. You should read the information below, and ask questions about anything you do not understand, before deciding whether or not to participate.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <b>PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL</b><br />
              Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you are free to choose whether to be in it or not. If you choose to be in this study, you may subsequently withdraw from it at any time without penalty or consequences of any kind.  The investigator may withdraw you from this research if circumstances arise which warrant doing so.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <b>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</b><br />
              The study seeks to test a system that combines sensors in a smart watch, location data from smart phones, and survey responses to determine the linkage between a person’s physical states and their moods. One of the smart phone sensors is a microphone, but it will be used only to measure speech energy (how loudly or softly you speak) and whether your or people around you are speaking (to evaluate turn-taking during conversation). It will not record what you say. The other smartwatch sensors are accelermeter, light sensor, and heart rate monitor. The heart rate sensor is not made for medical purposes and our researchers are not trained clinicians, therefore, we do not plan to notify you if a potentially abnormal reading is found during this study. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <b>PROCEDURES</b><br />
              If you volunteer to participate in this study, we would ask you to do the following things:<br />
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Download the app on your smartphone. </li>
              <li>Wear the smartwatch we will give and keep your smartphone with you while you are participating in the 3 week workshop. </li>
              <li>Respond to the survey questions about your mood sent to you via the app 4 times per day for the duration of 2 weeks.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              <b>POTENTIAL RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS</b><br />
              The primary risk associated with the study is release of your data, which will be transmitted from your watch and phone to a server. As a precaution, we plan to anonymize all data before storing it on the password protected server and encrypt it as well. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <b>POTENTIAL BENEFITS </b><br />
              The potential personal benefits of particpation are:<br />
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>During the study, you will have access to your survey responses and the sensor readings from your watch and phone, which will provide information on your moods and physical state over the course of the workshop.</li>
              <li>You will also have access to aggregated data from other people who have participated in similar studies in the past, so you can compare your results with theirs. </li>
              <li>At the end of the study, if you are interested, you can read the results in academic papers written based on the findings. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              We also envision that this research will provide insights into the linkages between physical states and mood, which may allow for the design of new kinds of systems to help to improve individual and group performance. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <b>PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION</b><br />
              No payment will be provided to study participants. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <b>CONFIDENTIALITY</b><br />
              Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can be identified with you will remain confidential and will be disclosed only with your permission or as required by law. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              As noted above, all sensor data will be stored on the database tied to a personal ID number for each participant. A separate key, linking participants’ names to the ID numbers will be stored in a separate location. All servers will be password protected, and all server data will be encrypted. 
            </p>
